This project help me to improve my practice skills in Python. 
For creating Telegram bot I used Python v.3.8 and library pyTelegramBotAPI. 
Also, for continuous operation of the bot I deploy it to remote server. For creating and
testing new functions I used Test-Bot which I launch locally. When new functions
have been tested and all bugs have been fixed, I deploy a stable version of bot with
help my CI/CD to remote server.
